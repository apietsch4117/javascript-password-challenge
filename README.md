# Javascript-Password-Challenge

## Description

This challenge is supposed to help us become familiar with Javascript functionality. I attempted to demonstrate my knowledge of Javascript during this challenge. It allows us to create a random password using javascript. I learned the process it takes to develop something seemingly simple from a user's perspective. 

## Usage

Click generate password and follow the prompts to create a new password.
